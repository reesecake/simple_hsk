This project aims to 'simplify' learning with the HSK tests by hosting the vocabulary lists of each level of the HSK 
tests. Each level approximately doubles the number of new words from the previous test; the purpose of simple_hsk is 
to allow each test's vocabulary list to be viewed _cumulatively_ and _non-cumulatively_.
